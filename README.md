# Analog Clock

This project is a simple and responsive analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock dynamically updates to display the current time with traditional hour, minute, and second hands. The numbers 1 through 12 are positioned around the clock face, and the clock is styled with custom CSS for an aesthetically pleasing look.

## Features
